When I was younger I liked to travel.
I tried to go abroad every vacation I had.
My family and I traveled a lot those days.
We have been to many contries - Turkish, France, Spain, Finland, Egypt.
We liked swimming in the sea and doing mountain sky.
We liked excursions and museum visiting as well.
But those happy days are gone.
Now, as we have grown older, we prefer to spend our holydays and vacations at our vilage house.
I really like this place because of clean air and because of its quetety.
The city we a living and working in is very noisy.
