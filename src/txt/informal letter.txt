Hi Mike,
What a pleasure to hear that you are coming to Moscow!
You should definitely visit the Red Square and the Kremlin.
These places are known to be well worth a visit.
I would also like to recomend that you visit some museums with great rare artifats.
I am sorry to say that I am extremely busy on Saturday, but luckily I am totaly free on Sunday.
Does sunday work for you?
See you soon, my dear friend.
Enjoy your trip.
Best wishes,
Viacheslav.
