Hi Mike,
What a pleasure to hear that you are coming to Moscow!
You should definitely visit the Red Square and the Kremlin.
These places are known to be well worth a visit.
I would also like to recomend that you visit some museums with great rare artifats.
I am sorry to say that I am extremely busy on Saturday, but luckily I am totaly free on Sunday.
Does sunday work for you?
See you soon, my dear friend.
Enjoy your trip.
Best wishes,
Viacheslav.


Dear Mr. Michael,
My name is Viacheslav Tuev. I email you to get to know if you are still interested in our conference.
I am glad in letting you know that our next conference is going to be held in May, the 15s.
The agenda, as well as the list of participants and additional information is in the attachment.

I think it would be interesting for you to know that according to a survey that we've conducted among our participants you were the most popular.
Congratulations!
The conference will  enable you to spread you ideas among a wide group of Russian developers and potential contributers to your project.
If it it convenient to you we can book a skype call to iron out any other problems that might arise.

We look forward to hearing from you.
We look forward to your replay.

Kind regards,
Viacheslav Tuev
