Dear Mr. Alex,

I've received your letter discribing the urgent problem that you have with our online shop.
If I understand you correctly you can see the "Go to chart" button on the screen but if you press on it, it won't bring you to the "Chart page".
This situation can happen because of the bad internet connection.
Could you please reboot your computer and reboot you router?
To reboot the router you need to unplug it form power and plug it back again after 5 seconds delay.
In case this dosen't help, please press the link from this letter in order one of our technicians can connect to your computer and look in to the problem directly.
The technician will help you to make this urgent order of yours.
I hope that he definitely will resolve the problem.

Kind regards,
Viacheslav Tuev.
