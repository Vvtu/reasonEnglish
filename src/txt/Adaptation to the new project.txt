Hi, Mike.
I would like to drop a couple of lines to you about my last project.
A new project is always a big challenge to me, because I need to meet a new team and a new leader as well.
The problems of adjusting to the new team may be not easy to sort out.
As far as this new project is concern it is a kind of completely different type of tasks that I have been dealing with last years.
If I successfully overcome the adaptation difficulties, I will not only stay a frontend developer but became a backend developer as well. That means I will be a full stack developer, another words, the universal developer.
Deep I my mind I know that It is exactly what I need and want.
I need to be a well demanded developer who can easily find a job.
In the modern world It is totally impossible to know everything. The only way to stay well demanded developer is to know right things â€“ the silver bullet.
I hope that my next project will show me a new horizon of knowledge and skills.
It will help me to fill confident in myself.
Now I am inspired by new opportunities and looking forward to start working.
Best regards,
Viacheslav Tuev
