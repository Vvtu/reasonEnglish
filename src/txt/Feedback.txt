Mr. Alex has been my teammate at the last project for a few months.
I have seen him in different situations and made my opinion about him.

I consider Mr. Alex is a very skilful developer and a good friend as well.
Every time I needed some  help I knew I could safely rely on him.
Three were many times he gave me support in difficult situations.
So, I know he is a really helpful person.

But, I think there is one problem with Mr. Alex.
Being a very decisive man he never listens to other colleagues.
He makes decisions on this own.

Mr. Alex has wonderful voice. He speaks a lot. He likes speaking.
But he dosen't like listening.
Furthermore he wants other people to listen to him for all time.
He dislikes when somebody makes objections.
