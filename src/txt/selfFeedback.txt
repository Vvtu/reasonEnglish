Viacheslav Tuev  self feedback.
I consider it is very important to keep up with times and to choose carefully what to learn next in our frontend technologies.
Once I made a great decision to learn such web technologies, as React and Redux. This choice turned out to be very useful for me for being a modern and demanded developer for some years.
But what can be such driver for me next?
After studding several approaches to fronted development and patterns I think Typescript can be the driver.
I believe I am familiar with Typescript to some extent, though I didn't have a chance to use it in production development. I have only touched it for sometime. I didn't like it very much at first sight. There were some more promising decisions, ReasonMl for example.
But I think that Typescript has won this race.
Now many developers consider the 2019 to be the Typescript's year. And I totally agree with them. At a present time, Typescript is a must for developing huge frontend applications. I want using Typescript in my next developing project.
Currently I am focused on studding English and consider this exercises as very important to me. I am doing an English course in our company and I think I have already some results. It is now more simply for me to read tech guides and papers in English. I stopped to read them in Russian. Now I am using English for that purpose.
In addition to English course I am doing a NodeJS course. It also has turned out to be quite helpful.
Because of that course I have got better understanding of frontend - backend interactions and have developed some helpful utilities for the automatization of my day work.
I am going to do an Angular and Vue courses in the future.
I think I am focused and thoughtful person. When they give me a task, I start to put myself in a special mode. I am trying to let my interest to the task growing and growing. After that I am fully focused on the task and can't think about anything else. And I am staying in such mode till and have this task resolved. The drawback of such approach is that it is difficult for me to do many tasks at the same time.
I love working for EPAM company. There are a lot of smart people hear in our company. It is a pleasure to work with them in comfortable environment, using mordent technologies and frameworks, developing complex applications. I think our goal is to make this process of development more effective.
