When I was younger I liked to travel.
I tried to go abroad every vacation I had.
My family and I traveled a lot those days.
We have been to many contries - Turkey, France, Spain, Finland, Egypt.
We liked swimming in the sea and doing mountain ski.
We liked excursions, enjoyed visiting old famous places or visiting museums as well, because we like history of different cultures.
But those happy days are gone.
Now, as we have grown older, we prefer to spend our holydays and vacations at our vilage house near the Moscow city.
we really like this place because it is a quiet place with clean fresh air.
The Moscow city, we are living and working in, is very noisy.
When I get to my village house I really can have rest and recreation time.
It is beatifull place with tall green trees and grass.
We have a big wooden house  with a garden of apple trees.
When we are here we have a lot of garden work to do. We need trimming grass, cutting some unnecesary trees , digging ground for our garden.
We had a lot of home shores too. But we like this activities because it is a sort of toglling from our office work in the Adaptation to the new project.txt
