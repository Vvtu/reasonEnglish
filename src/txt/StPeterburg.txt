Hello, my dear friend,
I've heard that you are going to visit St. Petersburg. Aren't you?
Great!
St. Petersburg is the most beautiful Russian city. I hope you will enjoy your journey.
I don't live in Petersburg but I have been these a couple of times on business trips.
To be honest I don't like to travel a lot, but my wife does like traveling.
St. Petersburg is her favorable place. She has been the many times there. She loves it.
From my point of view St. Petersburg looks like Paris or Amsterdam.
There are a lot of beautiful old palaces of the 18s centuries that are well worth a visit.
When I was visiting The Peterhof palace I noticed that it is looks like Versailles palace in France.
Now it is mostly used for international meetings and conferences.
When I was visiting The State Hermitage Museum, I thought that it seemed to me that I had already seen it because I had seen The Louvre in France.
The standard places for tourists to visit are:
The center of the City, Palace square, Vasilievsky island,  Mariinsky palace, Petropavlovskaya fortress, Alexander Park, Tsarskoe selo.
I look forward to your replay after your journey.
Best regards,
Viacheslav Tuev
