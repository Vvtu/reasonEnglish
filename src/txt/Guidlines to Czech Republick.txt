Guidelines.
As you all know, our team is going on a business trip to Prague the capital of the Czech Republic.
The duration of the trip is about two weeks. We are supposed to work at our customer's office for that  period time.
Here are some guidelines for the members of our team:
Our personal laptops should be taken with us to work in the customer's office.
Czechia has standard European electrical outlets, so this is no need to take with additional electrical adapters.
Please note that the mobile phone calls are expensive. Please avoid using them in order to cut down our costs. The customer is supposed to provide an internet connection for us, so you should use internet messenger for your communications.
The climate of Czechia is  warm and comfortable for this time of the year. The temperature is expected to be 20 degrees Celsius. However, the it is likely to be raining and windy.
You should wear normal clothes for the office.
Czechia has a liberal egalitarian culture. So, there shouldn't be any problems in communications with customer's representatives.
But, you should, as usual, avoid talking about politics and religious matters. It is better to be careful when talking about sports, especially ice hockey. Some people in Chechia are very sensitive about their national hockey team.
I hope that we'll have a very good trip.
