What I expect to happen in the next 10 years is a revolutionary change in our industry.
I've heard that in the near future every company in the world will turn into an IT company.
Banks, Universities, Hospitals as well as many other types of companies will have big IT departments.
New technological decisions will help us in communicative areas.
Remote working and outsorsing will become much more popular.
I also expect that our scientiests will find a way how to stop the global warming of our planet.
It could be a special screen - protecting Earth from the sun rays.
Another important problem that should be sorted out  is a risk of world war.
I am so anxious about that because I have three children and I want them to live a happy life.
I don't belive a real artificial intiligence will come to life in the next 10 years, but when it happens it will deffenitely change our life into something new - what we can't even imagine now.
I hope that the human race will not disappear because of that.
