I have seen many cultural differences when working with people from other counties  in my life.
The one point is the distance between people when they are talking with each other.
People from Midle Asia countries ( Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan for example) try to get vey close to you during a conversation.
It makes you feel a little uncomfortable when they communicate with you.
There is one more cultural difference, that I've seen a lot during talking. It is  a volume of speaking
I mean that some nationalities speak  too loudly. They seem to get used to shouting  all the time when they speak to each other. In fact, it is normal for them to speak loudly. One more important thing I want to mention is punctuality.
I like people to be punctual and I always try to be punctual myself.
But some peaple are not. That is considered normal in their culture to be always a litle bit late.

The more one thing that is very close to punctuality is politness.
People of some cultures, like Japan or China, are so polite in their maners and speach that sometimes I fail to understand what they want from me when speaking with them.
As for me, they seem to be over-polite.
There are many other points I could mention about cultural differences like  power distance, humburger way of talking.
But I am afraid I have no time to write about them.

Best regards.
