The pros and cons of setting up your own business.
I had been doing my own business for a number of years before I deceded to quit.
It was 5 years ago when I finally realized that I had to quit from such activity.
The main reason for my decision was that I had grown old and been tired of problems of doying buisiness.
I think I know a lot about pros and cons of setting your own business in my country.
Apprarently if you are the boss your feel more confident in yourself, besides you get more money for you and for your family.
But the problem is that you don't feel free. You are completely dependent on the situation in the market.
And the main problem is the relations with state authority.
You have  to deal with many rules, papers, verifications and so on. After getting through all these obstacles for ten years I have become a very nervious and scared person and quite an unhappy one.
I think the problem was in my nature. It is  obvious that I am not sutable for such life.
At the end I have came to the conclusion that I should change my life.
Now I work as a developer for IT company and started to be much happier.
