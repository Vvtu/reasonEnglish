My hobby.
Recently I started to love watching old movies.
At fisrt I was used to watching old movies because this activity could help me to switch my attention to something defferent from my daily work as an application developer in order to clear my mind after hard working every day.
So my hobby started as a kinda of recreation for keeping my mind in a good healthy state.
But then I found out that watching old movies can give me some sort of inspiration to work and can stop me from burn out.
It is very important thing for a software developer because this is strestfull work.
In particular, I like watching historical movies because I've always loved studying history. The knowledge of history helps us to understand the present time from a different point of view.
I am sure, we can become more patient when dealing with problems of our life by undestanding things from another porspective.
When you see a very old movie ( a masterpice ) you see the people of the past who are probably dead already.
But, they still could make us feel glory and pain. Somehow, I can say, they still live in their movies.
One of the best masterpices, I've ever seen, is the exciting naive fairy tale for children - "Wizard of OZ" .
I like the way how the actors of this masterpice look and act. I like how they speak.
This movie has made me feel happier.
Those great people who made this movie managed to make our world a better place.
