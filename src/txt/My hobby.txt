My My hobby.
Last time I started to love watching old movies.
At fisrt I was used to watching old movies because this activity could help me to toggle my attention to something defferent from my dayly work as a application developer in order to clear my mind after hard working every day.
So my hobby started as a kinda recreation cure for keeping my mind in a good healthy condition.
But then I found out that to see the old movies can give me some sort of inspiration to work and can protect me from burning out.
It is very important thing for a software developer.
I think this happens because I always love studying history. The knowledge of history lets us to understand the present time from a different point of view.
I am sure, we can become more patient when dealing with problems of our life by undestanding things from another prospective.
When you see a very old movie ( a masterpice ) you see the people of the past time who are probably dead already.
But, they still could make us feel a glory and a pain. Somehow, I can say, they still live in their movies.
One of the best masterpice, I've ever seen, is the exciting naive fairy tale for children - "Wizard of OZ" .
I've liked the way how the actors of this masterpice look and act. I've liked how they speak.
This movie has made me feel more happier.
Those blessing people who make this movie managed to make our world a better place.
